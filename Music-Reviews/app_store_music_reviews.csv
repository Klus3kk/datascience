Deezer,US,Must have a premium account to download music,"I got this music app so I could download songs and listen to them on airplane mode. It requires you to make an account and pick your favorite artists only to say you have to pay in order to download songs. Waste of my time.

Spotify,US,Aesthetic Interface and Playlist and Soccer l Discovery Power.,"Podcast functionality is lacking, if you compare to Apple’s IPod app. Nevertheless that can be negligible in terms of overall total package: Spotify wins.

Smaller phones with smaller batteries should focus on a function per app basis.

Spotify’s multi-function is designed for big phones with big batteries to take advantage of the full experience.

Spotify,US,Ai and weird shuffling,"Despite having a playlist of thousands of songs I am constantly only hearing the same songs over and over again on shuffle. Please Spotify just make a completely randomized shuffle, no algorithm. I can not stand this anymore. This app has consistently shown they care more for money than costumers.

Spotify,US,Relax,"Please stop with the interruptions — the pop ups/overs, the moving things around, rearranging things, changing things etc…

I value consistency and simplicity. 

It’s annoying to log in, see a layout then have it shuffle under your finger and then make the wrong selection.

Also annoying is the automatic refresh to the home page and all the irrelevant recommendations. I would like to simply pick up where I left off, not have to start over every time I open the app. 

Just keep it simple and quit over-developing.",1,2025-05-21 17:21:46-07:00

Spotify,US,Disappointed,I have been a 5+ year listener and I am sad to say that I am thinking about switching to Apple Music…the songs are skipping roughly 10 seconds every half hour or so. None of the updates have solved the issue and it is becoming very distasteful to use the app to listen to music. I have done all of the recommended solutions to stop the skipping and it doesn’t seem to be helping.,3,2025-05-21 17:13:42-07:00
Spotify,US,Best,This app is great for listen for music and I would recommend it. Make sure to get the premium pass because it doesn’t make you listen to adds and plays the song right away,5,2025-05-21 17:08:33-07:00
Shazam,US,Using Shazam,"Someone set Shazam up for me years ago.

Spotify,US,Disappointing!!!,"Oh what a poorly designed app! Super user-unfriendly! Great selection of songs, but…
For example: Can’t look for one artist and add multiple songs of that same artist to the playlist. Or: When randomly playing a playlist it always plays the same songs in the same order and seems to never hit others. There seems to be no way to manually rearrange the order of songs, so I could just play it from top to bottom - at least than all songs would get playtime…
If this was V0.1, I’d say: good start, but still far to go.
However this has been around for an eternity, and every fricking week there’s an update! And it still is such a sad excuse of an app!
If I’d know of a decent alternative, I’d delete that thing and never look at it again!!!",1,2025-05-21 16:48:07-07:00

It has all my favorites like Tate McRae and Country music, but I don’t like that there is an ad after every song.

Spotify,GB,Recent update from May 2025,"Great features of the app, but updates of removing iconic ""heart"" symbol in linking musing and other stuff. But the most disappointing and quite annoying, last update, adding ""create"" album ""+"" symbol at the home bottom line. And now instead of pressing ""your library"" I tend to press create albums which already have their feature at the top of the screen. Can the developers look into this? 

This little gestures with unnecessary updates are quite confusing. Best option would be to allow users to create their home screen, like in an iPhone, you can move the icons. Same can be possibly implemented too.

Apple Music,US,Disorganized,"Obviously Apple Music has a ton of music. That’s great! The main issue I have with Apple Music is the mis-categorization of album tracks. So many times I’ve asked Siri to play an album and half the songs aren’t even from the actual album. They’re typically live or alternate versions of the songs, e.g. Kid A by Radiohead. I just want to hear the album! Another issue I’ve experienced numerous times is that I’ll download an album and, later, an anniversary edition will come out, causing most, if not all, of the tracks I downloaded to no longer be available. Super annoying! I know it’s not everyone, but some people still enjoy listening to an entire studio album, the way the band intended it to be released.",2,2025-05-21 08:00:11-07:00

For the time being I’m going back to my old music app that I have premium for. I only began on Spotify just for lyrics on Rammstein.",3,2025-05-20 23:56:06-07:00

Spotify,AU,Irresponsible ad’s on free version,"I’ve used Spotify for years now and while it’s good for a diverse range of music listening, I’ve found when using the free version, there are quite a few re-occurring issues.
I find it extremely irresponsible on Spotify's part to push horror and thriller movie trailer ads without any warning, playing in between songs.
Since ads are no longer skip-able after 5 seconds, nor are there content ratings (such as G, PG, M, ect), people driving and other hands free listeners can be jump scared when these unexpected and sometimes disturbing ads pop up (Potentially causing accidents on the road).
Furthermore, there are no trigger warnings for those who may be (understandably) sensitive to certain themes.
Even though the premium version is ad free, it doesn’t sit well with me that users may have to pay just to avoid this potentially harmful situation.

This is only one problem, among MANY that I hope Spotify decides to listen to and take the time to amend.",2,2025-05-20 23:43:33-07:00

Cons: Not being able to block podcast content you don’t want. The fact the AI DJ doesn’t have an accent that matches the country you’re listening in. That local content seems to get buried under a mass of generic top 40pop stuff.

SoundCloud,US,A Fantastic Alternative to Spotify,"My Opinion:

I’ve been using SoundCloud for over 8 years, and I can say with certainty that it is my favorite place to listen to music.

A more in-depth review will show how comparable it is to other platforms, and how it could rival that of even Spotify. 

Compare and Contrast:

First thing I want to make clear is that this section will focus mainly on the comparison between SoundCloud and Spotify as I do not harbor much experience with other platforms. (Pandora, Amazon Music, etc.) 

Secondly, no, SoundCloud is not just a 1:1 recreation of Spotify with tiny adjustments. 

In fact, the two platforms differ vastly in feature richness as well as their goals. This simply means SoundCloud may have features that Spotify doesn’t and vice versa, but what makes a music platform appealing is what they offer to their users. 

Sure, Spotify may have certain features over SoundCloud, for example lyrics, video, and such, but SoundCloud has always put its listeners convenience over novelty. 

Despite not having newer features, SoundCloud still puts in the necessary baseline features to make listening enjoyable. 

The overwhelming support given to artists/creators has been a staple to SoundCloud’s brand to this day. They ensure their priorities are in line with everyone’s goals. 

Regarding Ads, yes, the app still has ads for free listening. The leniency on ad breaks is fair but not great. 

Although, what Spotify lacked long ago is what SoundCloud has made up for—specifically functionality!

SoundCloud may have had frequent ads, but Spotify used to give free listeners highly restricted functionality on its platform. 

SoundCloud didn’t have this problem. The fact that free listeners were limited to only a few skips or repeats, what’s worse, wait an extra day before they refreshed is unbelievable! SoundCloud gave this to listeners from the get go as far back as launch. This includes free skips, loops, scanning, all of it all day everyday. 

\\\ /// IMPORTANT! \\\ ///

One caveat I will mention, however, is that most labeled artist will be locked behind a premium but everything else is free.

/// \\\ /// \\\         /// \\\ /// \\\

One last thing, and this  bit is partial biased, but I prefer the recommendations on SoundCloud better. They just know what I like. As in, not only do they play songs I’ve already listened to, but they bring me new songs and artists I’ve never ever heard of that sound shockingly in tune to what I listen to on the regular. So it has helped me develop my musical taste.

TL:DR

Conclusions:

Should you use SoundCloud?

In short, 

If you like free casual listening, yeah, absolutely. It’s a great option for a great time.

If you want rich innovative features, no, not really. The app is better suited for an audience of regulars, rather than an audience of mixtape DJs

If you took the time to read this entire review, thens many thanks to you for reading. 

Hopefully this gave you some insight and inspires you to try the app for yourself.",5,2025-05-20 18:55:32-07:00

ちなみに調べて出てきた方法
・プレイリストに15曲以上入れる
・再生→類似の曲の自動再生をオフにする
・Spotifyプレミアムに入る
1番上はまだデビューしたばかりのグループで曲が3曲しかないので無理。Spotifyプレミアムなんて入った暁には課金沼に陥るので1番下も無理。真ん中なんて1回試してはアプリ再起動スマホ再起動を5回は繰り返して結局ダメでした。

Spotify,GB,Audiobook rip off,"WHY DO I NEED TO BUY A TOP-UP TO LISTEN TO AUDIOBOOKS!? 
Have been using Spotify and paying my premium subscription for years. Recently I have gotten into audiobooks, and use Spotify for these usually with no issue.  I have started a new job working 12 hour night shifts and love having an audiobook on in the background. Imagine my disgust when my listening is interrupted and I am told to buy a top up to keep listening! 
I have the best subscription available and now have to pay ANOTHER £9 to get 10 more hours of listening time! (That’s not even a full shift of listening!) Which, by the way, I’m not able to do within the app itself. 
Guess I’ll just have listen to Joe F^<king Rogan podcasts now.
Totally shameful and disappointing cash grab. 
Premium not premium (Amazon effect).
I will not be buying “top ups” out of principle.

If you’re looking for a less popular song you’ll be scrolling for a longer time. And you need tot type the whole song name. I hope the app will get a deserved update soon to fix these issues.

TIDAL,SE,TIDAL Removes Core Functionality That Once Set It Apart,"After the 2 latest updates, TIDAL removed one of the features I relied on most: the ability to view and follow composers through the credits. It is now only possible to follow performing artists and view tracks they appear on — a significant downgrade. This was one of TIDAL’s few distinguishing features, especially considering that its music recommendations are noticeably weaker than Spotify’s. The composer tracking feature helped bridge that gap. Now, with only audio quality remaining — which is also available on platforms like Apple Music. What’s even more frustrating is that the changelog stated the update only included bug fixes, without any mention of the removal of such core functionality. This lack of transparency undermines user trust. Adding to the confusion, when you search for a composer, they still appear in the search results — often with a brief description under their name indicating their role as a songwriter, producer, or engineer. However, tapping on their name leads to a near-empty profile displaying the message: “Artist profile is empty. This artist hasn’t released any tracks. Follow them to be notified if they do.” It’s baffling and frankly misleading. Why have you deleted all composers profiles TIDAL!? Several of my friends recently switched to TIDAL specifically because of the ability to follow songwriters. Removing one of the platform’s most valuable and unique features is not only short-sighted — it’s outright self-sabotaging.",1,2025-05-19 13:03:02-07:00

Also I’ve used Deezer for like 3 years now and you used to be able to see the lyrics but now you have to pay to see the lyrics which you can do for free with Shazam.

Software is glitchy, especially if you live where you need to switch between online or offline mode, it doesn’t work well. Downloads for playlists can take months, no lie I have playlists that are six months old that haven’t finished downloading. shuffle sucks, it plays the same shuffled songs every time even though these playlists have 500 or so songs. And most aggravating, apparently the folks at Tidal have no idea of how to even out the playback volume of different songs. There’s a setting for it but it doesn’t do anything.

海外の曲名が勝手に翻訳されたり、カタカナ表記になったりしないのは非常にグッド。

改良をお願いしたいポイントとして、PC版で作成できるプレイリストフォルダ。そのプレイリストフォルダの中に200以上プレイリストがあった時、200個目以上のプレイリストは表示がされない。（プレイリストとして存在はしてるんだけど、名前やサムネが表示されずタッチしても反応なし）
PC版で見れば200以上あっても全部見れるんだけど、アプリ版だけ出来ない。技術的出来ないってことはないと思うので、出来ればすぐに対応をお願いしたいところ。

やっぱりプレイリストをフォルダ分けして管理できるのは非常にグッドな点だから、その機能はふんだんに使いたいよね。",4,2025-05-19 07:42:50-07:00

Apple Music,CA,Not true bit-perfect lossless audio. Price too high.,"The lossless audio files used by Apple Music are not true ALAC files, but are movpkg files, a package of audio fragments that are pieced together on the fly as they are played back. This means they are not bit-perfect replications of the 16- or 24-bit studio masters and cannot be played back in anything other than Apple Music. This is such a shame for paying customers because it means DRM is back worse than ever before with Apple Music audio.
Because of these issues, the monthly subscription price is unjustifiably high. I’ll be looking elsewhere for true lossless audio downloads until Apple corrects this misleading “feature”.

Das größte Problem für mich ist jedoch, dass ich beim Musik hören per Bluetooth Verbindung (mein Auto hat kein CarPlay) im Gegensatz zu allen anderen mir bekannten Musik Streaming Apps nicht vorwärts oder rückwärts zu einem anderen Lied springen kann. Wenn ich also den Titel wechseln will, müsste ich mein iPhone verbotenerweise während der Fahrt bedienen.

Naive maybe but I never went along with the notion these services could serve up more of what you enjoy.  Possibly it was  because I’d never stayed long enough.  Now I’ve been with Deezer for several years, I feel at ease and the music just keeps coming home.

SoundCloud,GB,Missing albums and artist account for a listener?,"It would be nice to be able to switch off “artist” account. I’m a listener I don’t account that let’s my upload my own songs…

Also can you ask artists to put their whole discography on your platform please? They have it on different platforms… For example Björk. It’s nice to ask us to pay for Go+ but please give us something that is worth paying for. I love indie artists but also bigger names.

Also, please do not artists’ music to train AI.",3,2025-05-14 06:08:48-07:00
TIDAL,ES,Esta es mi reseña sobre tidal y su aplicación,"Hola, me llamo Julián y soy un audiofilo, a diferencia de muchos usuarios que han dejado aquí la reseña que por lo que escribieron me hacen pensar que son usuarios comunes, o voy a hacer estar crítica desde el lado audifilo
Tengo varios auriculares dedicados: focal utopia, fiio fx17, campfire astrolith, Chord mojo 2, angel earmen, xduo tubular etc… me parece que el sonido de tidal es realmente bueno, si lo comparo con Qobuz parece ligeramente más cálido, prefiero Tidal que Qobuz porque su catálogo es más grande y tengo más canciones, además actualmente ya no usan MQA por lo cual es otra razón que me hace decantarme por tidal y no por otras palabras plataformas de música, pero e visto un fallo que es realmente crítico y muy importante, resulta que cuando pongo el iPhone a reproducir música conectado a mi dac mojo 2 parece ser que después de terminar la pista no actualiza la frecuencia en su siguiente pista… y siempre se queda marcando la frecuencia de la primera pista cuando le di a reproducir mis playlist de música, al principio pensé que quizás era ese dac que no actualiza de forma independiente la frecuencia al empezar la otra prisa así que realice la prueba con 4 dac/amp diferentes y no actualizaba al frecuencia, solo actualiza cuando yo de forma manual desbloqueo el iPhone y le doy a avanzar la pista para empezar a reproducir la siguiente pista, en ese caso sí que todos marcaban la nueva pista con la resolución correcta a la que estaba grabada… eso es un fallo muy grave para una aplicación basada en la mejor calidad de audio y es la única de todas las aplicaciones de música actuales que tiene ese fallo… deberían hacer una corrección del error en una nueva versión lo antes posible…",3,2025-05-14 06:06:47-07:00

Completely disappointed. And no way to complain or report in the app.

Searching for ‘Live’ shows is clumsy.
The AI music curator is completely predictable. It’s a 1, 2, 3… cycle of anything you have favourited. 1 playlist, 2 playlist, 3 playlist. Repeat.
Furthermore the “create a station” option on a song, will morph into a category completely unrelated to ANYTHING you would choose, and often, stuff personally would be called “play less of this.”

Very annoying systems on Apple Music.

It’s tough to navigate and discover unfamiliar music. As an example, if I listen to ’Lounge’ genre, it’s difficult to locate any “Classical” genre music. If I NEVER want to play “Rap” the app FORCES Rap genre music to play regardless. Several functions that are extremely disappointing.",1,2025-05-13 14:25:18-07:00

2: Non tutte le canzoni hanno i testi e non tutti i testi sono tradotti, io aggiungerei la possibilità di caricarli noi utenti, con un piccolo bonus premio da parte vostra, per l’aiuto datovi! 😜
3: sarebbe meraviglioso avere ciò che ha un app rivale: il codice canzone, per poterlo condividere, per esempio, si può incidere o stampare su più supporti, quali magliette, oggetti in legno, tazze, braccialetti, ecc. ecc., per poi inquadrarlo con la fotocamera tramite app, ed essere così portato direttamente ad ascoltare quella canzone, album o playlist…

Now I can’t even listen to Spotify because the audio quality on apple music is just 100 times better, you can really hear everything crispy and clear. I also love how they have Dolby atmos integrated and the Spatial Audio works better than the spotify one because the Apple Music one just sounds more clear and the bass is more rich. I usually don’t pay to listen to music but Apple Music is such a game changer so if your looking to hear some super high quality, rich in bass type of audio - Apple Music is def the go to!",5,2025-05-11 05:51:31-07:00

Takk for at Spotify fortsatt finnest. Man kan høre på akkuratt den sangen man vil. Eg liker at man kan lage spillelister og kan dele spillelistene med andre i kontakta. Eg liker og at eg kan høre på mussik gjennom øreklokker. Elsker Spotify og det er bra det er gratis å ha det.

Je m’attendais à ce que ce soit un peu inconfortable mais … pas à ce point !
- l’accès aux podcast est hyper compliqué. Impossible de les avoir sur sa page d’accueil quand bien même j’en écoute tous les jours. Je dois fouiner pour voir si de nouveaux épisodes sont sortis.
- le volume sonore entre chaque morceau est très inégal. C’est super désagréable à l’écoute.
- la version carplay existe … vu ce qu’elle propose, elle pourrait tout aussi bien rester dans les limbes.
- impossible de blacklister un « artiste » sans devoir écouter le morceau pour pouvoir cliquer sur le cœur barré et ne plus suggérer l’auteur.
- impossible de rejoindre l’abonnement de ma famille car j’ai deux mois de premier offerts.. auxquels il est interdit de mettre fin ! 
- en lisant les avis, la plupart sont des avis forcés pour débloquer le mode hors ligne… loin d’être honnête de la part de Deezer.

SoundCloud,NO,Avoid this garbage,"I used to be a subscriber and uploaded hundreds of tracks. 
Unfortunately SoundCloud has gone steadily downhill for years and now it’s hit rock bottom with assuming consent to use your music to train AI.

Apple Music,CA,Good app,I really like this! I think the mute the lyrics kind of thing is AWESOME!! I would really like for it to maybe have a button so that maybe you can play one part of it to the other of the song..!

TIDAL,US,Abysmal performance,"Has the best selection (at least for my tastes), good sound quality, a reasonable price now, and I don’t mind the recommendation system. But the search system is horrendous- the worst I’ve seen, the worst I could imagine, the worst I could imagine imagining. It’s easier to find a playlist, click on an artist, go to their page, find the related artists, find an artist in that list, go through their albums, and find the song you’re looking for than to search for that song.
Update: the app has gotten much, much worse over the last six months or so. When I have a perfect internet signal and every single other app on my phone works perfectly, Tidal struggles. More often that not, I have to refresh a page to load it. This is beyond unacceptable and if it is not fixed soon I will switch to a different streaming platform, even though Tidal is the best option in almost every other way.",2,2025-05-09 17:31:00-07:00

SoundCloud,CA,Big kev ✝️☦️The soundcloud “everywhere guy”,"Hi, This is Big Kev! K.L. too if you want to see my other none kinda copy cat name style you could say I” 'm Kevin Lervone! Um, I started SoundCloud back in 2021 or around so I was a small boy at the time I never touched the internet so didn't have many friends and never had much value in life. So when I first dropped out of high school I was terrified I had no real thought about what to do. I was fat I was about 210lbs or close I drank soda and such and my cause words were at the roof. So I picked my cross I searched value and I made SoundCloud and picked up on that “gym arc” 😭 it all started with Sigma edits yes. But after I lost all my ego and actually pushed for ideas for What the community needed a Good friend and so I actually trained hard and got fit and did my goals, etc.. Um, it started as a gig but I actually put my dedication and sweat into the time spent in the app. My first account “Kevin Lervone” made it to the top of the top just like the Alaska tower and yes unfortunately the downside of Soundcloud is copyright, strike, overuse or phono blasted audios false strike, etc. I was a problem too that I got a strike on my main account and I was angry I was mad but then I made my second and I actually couldn't been more happy and soundcloud artist is good but not a full time paying job unless you hit the brakes to the roof and you dont  want to do that because then you burn out and I know when you hit the gym too hard you get plated out and smack to the face and I was never seen as a great man but I done my deed to the lord and as I when to seek value in it.. In the lord I find purpose I found good and what I seek of and in that I am always thankful for that. ☦️✝️ as always pray and stay strong don't let pride or lust be a downfall I learn that from bodybuilding it not about the ideas of what you think of it. It is how you work hard and discipline and show up for it. Honestly I learn so much from it and I actually still somewhat active but less than before as Napoleon and the conquer of times we shouldn't idolize them but they ideas where to take and have value and in bodybuilding that what it take a face from thought of it.  Love thy neighbours as you”re own. Anaways stay safe stay working hard in all the thing you do! I hope my story and my experience with SoundCloud is a take to see of.",5,2025-05-09 11:27:46-07:00

Depuis quelques mois j’ai des lenteurs au lancement de l’application.
L’interface de l’application mobile ne répond plus pendant 1 minute et finit soit par se débloquer, soit par un crash de l’application.
Vider le cache ne résout pas le problème.
Le seul moyen que j’ai pour retrouver un fonctionnement nominal est de réinstaller l’application.
Je ne trouve pas de section dédiée à la déclaration de bugs sur votre site, donc j’utilise cette la partie des avis Apple à cet effet. C’est dommage…

Pouvez-vous m’aider à retrouver un fonctionnement nominal de votre application?

There are still occasional songs which, as popular as they are, don’t always get “picked up” by Shazam, and this can be quite frustrating!

If the app is open (like when choosing songs) you get video only ads which cannot be listened to in the background, totally ridiculous for a music app that people typically use cell data for.

Yes, the interface is clean and looks good but it has a delay whenever clicking on a song. I get logged out at the most random times. Music stops playing because I get a “no internet connection” when I do.

TIDAL,US,"Good in Theory, Hardly Functions in Practice","I switched to Tidal mainly because of their higher royalty rate to artists, and compatibility with 3rd Party DJ apps. But the bugginess of the app is so frustrating, I oftentimes can’t use it at all. Today alone I have deleted and reinstalled the app three times just to make it play again. And even now the login page is set to an infinite loop that won’t let me log in. Good in principle but so unreliable its incredibly frustrating.

PROS
+ Pays Higher Royalty Rate to Artists

+ Compatible with DJ Apps (for extra fee 😒)

+ High Fidelity Streaming

+ Good “Similar to” Shuffle Algorithm

CONS
- Frustratingly buggy for a major platform

- Higher Cost

- Has much difficulty connecting to devices (ie. Chromecast)

- Often unable to load or play music for unknown reasons

- Incompatible with Siri (can ask her to play Spotify but not Tidal)",4,2025-05-06 07:13:22-07:00

Apple Music,IT,Sarebbe perfetta se…,"La qualità dello streaming é ottima e la differenza, usando cuffie o impianto hifi, é apprezzabile.

Di recente c’è stata l’integrazione con Alphatheta di Piooner che consente di mixare i brani scegliendo Apple Music come sorgente. Tanta roba (solo per alcune console).


Il discover non é ai livelli di Spotify, cosi anche come la ricerca di brani/playlist. Potrebbe essere fatto un lavoro migliore. 

Il neo più grande é la mancanza del sync streaming. Esempio, ho configurato su Amazon Echo ma non posso effettuare il controllo dall’app come avviene per gli altri servizi di streaming. Al più posso connettermi tramite BT oppure devo interagire direttamente con il dispositivo, non sempre agevole. Spero che lo implementino.",4,2025-05-05 11:40:58-07:00

Meestal resulteert dat in een luid buzz kabaal en kan ik mijn Marantz niet meer bedienen, of start ie vanzelf opnieuw op. 

Lijkt me niet gezond en ik durf de app nu niet meer te gebruiken. Ik ben bang dat de boel kapot gaat. 

Via de HEOS app kan ik nog wel via Tidal streamen. Maar dat is een rudimentair gebeuren. De update begin mei 2025 heeft geen verbetering gebracht. 

De helpdesk van TIDAL kan je niet verder helpen. Waarschijnlijk ligt het probleem bij een verkeerde implementatie van ‘Tidal Connect’ door Marantz. En hebben veel andere bezitters van soortgelijke apparaten bij Marantz er last van.  Dat vertelde hún helpdesk. Wees voorlopig daarom maar even voorzichtig met deze app. Ook al kan TIDAL er zelf waarschijnlijk niets aan doen.

Deezer,CA,The best app ever,"Firstly, I am truly grateful to the developers and founders for this incredible music platform that continues to grow and improve.
Secondly, I want to thank you for supporting Ukraine by opening Premium access to users from this country — that gesture was incredibly important back then and still means a lot today.
Thirdly, the presence and intensity of ads is a standard practice in all apps used without a premium subscription — not just music apps. People work, people support the service, people get paid. So if you’re not paying for a subscription, you’re “paying” by listening to ads. Unfortunately, that’s how it works — always and without exception.

Your recommendation algorithms, curated suggestions, playlist creation features, the ability to share music with friends — all of it is top-tier. If it wasn’t like this five years ago, it definitely works now, and it works well. You can tell the team cares, works hard on the product, and keeps moving forward.

Thank you for your support, for an amazing product, and for giving us a way to escape reality from time to time ;)

You’re amazing guys!",5,2025-05-01 23:29:00-07:00

Deezer,GB,Design issue with recent update,"In general, I absolutely love Deezer for how many new artists I've discovered that I never would have without it. I’ve been a premium subscriber for well over ten years now. 

Generally the app works pretty well, but I do have one gripe at the moment, a result of a recent redesign. Please reinstate the button at the centre of the player screen (above the play button, think it was an ellipsis housed in a circle) from where you could select the artist, album, add to playlist etc. You’ve moved this menu to the ellipsis at the top right of the screen, which is way too far away (with how big phones are these days) when whizzing through the app/checking out similar artists/trying to rapidly build new playlists. 

It’s also a bit laggy with searches at the moment, I’m finding it often takes several attempts to get the cursor to show in the search bar. Loading of the app when offline, even offline playlists, also often takes quite a while. 

Other than these points, big fan.",3,2025-05-01 21:24:46-07:00

I have no idea who I like or who I want to like I don’t want to be told that I must like and follow anyone especially not a ridiculous amount like 15.
In settings you can go in and remove those 15 artists however it then adds them to the excluded list so youll never hear anything from them, so you delete them from the excluded list and guess what? It’s adds it back to the recommendations list!!!

Apple Music,AU,Almost perfect…,Apple Music is really the only worthwhile streaming service. Long may it continue. But we need to talk about volume jumps. There ought to be three clicks of the volume button for the every one there is now. It’s a massive jump as is. This has been a bugbear for years and it would be nice to be able to fine tune it more easily than using the finicky volume slider in Control Centre.,3,2025-04-30 08:05:47-07:00

Apple Music,ES,If you added an “Islam” genre I’d consider buying a subscription,"Look. If this is ever read, I know what you’re thinking. It’s not worth it, you’ll face backlash. I’ve read, ahem, ignorant Apple support discussions about people who are uncomfortable about the fact that Arab and Muslim people exist. I know that you’re worried about being “woke-boycotted” more than you already have been in the past or maybe currently. But I think I and many millions or at least hundreds of thousands would appreciate you having more Muslim content. You have a gospel and a Christian section but not an “Islam”section. 2 billion people. At least you could have a little “spirituality section” on the “Radio (((•)))” section of the app. Where you put Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, New Age, Atheist/ Rationalist, Hindu, Taoist, etc. content. I would appreciate it and would make me consider buying a subscription. If you’re still reading, again, I acknowledge the potential flashback. There are too many people on here leaving reviews that are simply “WHAT THE HECK? WHY ARE YOU RECOMMENDING ME THINGS THAT AREN’T THE THINGS I LIKE? WHY ARE YOU SO WOKE / SO DECADENT AND RECOMMENDING ME THINGS MEANT FOR PEOPLE WHO DON’T BELONG TO MY SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC?”",5,2025-04-28 23:05:34-07:00

Apple Music,BR,"Muito bom, porém...","Usei o Apple Music por algum tempo. A usabilidade do aplicativo é muito boa, tudo muito ""clean"" e agradável, qualidade sonora excelente. Porém, existem alguns pontos negativos. O primeiro, a curadoria é fraca, em comparação a concorrência, que cria diversas playlists, baseadas no gosto musical do usuário. Alguns álbuns  as músicas são repentinamente separadas em outros álbuns, fazendo com que o painel de álbuns vire uma bagunça e vc não consiga ouvir um álbum completo, precisa ficar procurando a música que foi separada. Essa foi a maior influência para eu ter cancelado a minha assinatura. Por último, o fato de eu sair e minhas escolhas musicais serem excluídas caso eu não renovasse a assinatura, isso interfere muito na minha decisão de não voltar mais. Se eu assinar de novo, elas estarão lá? Provavelmente não. Falta de compatibilidade com o Chromecast e outros televisores, tenho 3 smartvs em casa, nenhuma delas tem acesso ao Apple Music. Aplicativo para Windows é muito ruim, fica o tempo todo deslogando e tem problema de conexão com equipamentos bluetooth através do Windows.",3,2025-04-27 06:11:43-07:00

It doesn’t recognize half the songs I play for it and sometimes gives the wrong songs multiple times in a row. There are moments when you play a song for it and it gives you 4-5 different results! How is that even possible?! They also removed the ability to see the history of your songs without having been forced to go to the app, this last change is infuriating as the app is very buggy and sometimes takes forever to open. I think Apple did major updates to the app and that has had an adverse affect on everything, from the user experience to ease of use and accuracy.

TIDAL,DE,Spitze - ABER!,"TIDAL ist im Grunde eine wirklich gute App. Die grafische Aufarbeitung ist toll, die Wiedergabeleistung ebenfalls. Ich nutze TIDAL sehr intensiv und höre darauf in allen Variationen, zu Hause über Streaming, selbst im Auto über den Offline Modus…. Und genau hier beginnt es mit dem „ABER“. Den im Grunde nutze ich sobald ich zu Hause verlasse wirklich alles über den Offline Modus, denn ich will unterwegs einfach nicht streamen, aufgrund dessen das wenn ich das mobil tun muss ich immerzu den mobilen Funk oder ein W-LAN aktiviert haben muss, was ich aufgrund der enormen dauernden Strahlenbelastung nicht will. (UND ja, Mobilfunk, W-LAN ist schädlich, die Studienlage weltweit ist erdrückend) Nun muss wirklich bei jedem Mal wenn man den Flugmodus irgendwo aktiviert und man will offline Musik hören die Anmeldeprozedur erneuert werden, sonst werden die Offline gespeicherten Playlisten nicht angezeigt und nicht gespielt. Das nervt enorm, denn das kommt einfach täglich vor, wenn man eben das Smartphone immer wieder in den Flugmodus versetzt. Will man dann Musik offline gespeichert genießen, geht das bei TIDAL einfach nicht, weil man immerzu prüft, hat der oder die gute den nun wirklich gezahlt….. ja habe ich, aber jeden Tag mehrfach diese Prozedur durchführen ist einfach ärgerlich. Vor nicht zu langer Zeit (1,2 Jahre) konnte man dies bei TIDAL noch anders regeln und die Prozedur war dann vielleicht einmal im Monat fällig, was auch im Grunde wirklich reichen würde. Hier ist TIDAL einfach überhaupt nicht benutzerfreundlich und es wäre enorm super, würde man zu dieser Praxis wieder zurück kehren. DENN, wie TIDAL nutzt, steigt hier i.d.R. nicht ein und aus und somit wäre der einmalige Check pro Monat bzgl. Der Offline Thematik vollkommen ausreichend. TIDAL aufwachen bitte, danke.",3,2025-04-22 21:18:08-07:00

The followers section is random, make it alphabetically so could be easy when you have to search for someone... the point that I can't leave a message is very frustrating, now I download it just to leave a message but then will delete the app, do you really think that's smart?

Deezer,US,My Review,If have decent sit up and have settings on HiFi it’s great. The loading times or little slow and takes hot minutes to act right and be fluid. Don’t like recent updates AIO now it’s more frustrating than before to add things to multiple playlists. It’s in top corner now and it’s clicking in and out some much! It’s killing the flow of finding a song and trying putting it to multiple playlists to much faff back & forth. It be nice if it had better recommended songs when hit the Flow button and insert new songs being new songs to me not exactly new songs necessarily. App lil pricey I would get Fam pack but to much of my taste. All these stream apps are getting old with constant subscription for all them out not they fault personally just side rant. Other then that it’s good addition if you don’t have music streaming services yet or like High Fidelity music with right in house set up.,4,2025-04-20 20:32:48-07:00

TIDAL,CA,From a First-Time User & Former Spotify Listener,"As a longtime Spotify user, I decided to give TIDAL a shot out of curiosity—and honestly, I’m glad I did. The first thing that stood out to me was the sound quality. TIDAL’s HiFi and Master tracks really do sound noticeably better, especially with good headphones or speakers. It’s one of those things you don’t realize you’re missing until you hear it.

The interface is clean and easy to navigate. It took a minute to adjust after coming from Spotify, but it wasn’t a difficult switch at all. I actually found the music discovery and editorial playlists really solid—maybe even more thoughtful and intentional than Spotify’s algorithm-based ones.

I also like that TIDAL seems to put more emphasis on the artists. There’s a sense of curation and respect for the music that I didn’t always feel on Spotify. And knowing that TIDAL pays artists more fairly is definitely a plus.

That said, Spotify still has the edge when it comes to social features and some integrations (like lyrics syncing and playlist sharing). But for pure music listening, TIDAL has been a really refreshing change. I’ve been enjoying it a lot more than I expected.

If you care about audio quality and a more artist-driven experience, it’s definitely worth the switch.",5,2025-04-20 00:21:43-07:00

Deezer,GB,AGHHHHHH,"Deezer i have been your ride or die for years, whilst my friends threw rotten tomatoes and laughed at me for not using Spotify I stood by you like a mother with their child, I feel a motherly love for Deezer but right now I am very close to putting you up for adoption 
I was about to have my nightly routine of listening to music when I click on the downloaded music flooded and…what is this? Where is my downloaded music? The only option is shuffle my music? What if I don’t want to shuffle my music? Then what? Am I kicked out the Deezer squad? Is this a cool kids only club? 

I am heartbroken, the only way to see all my music now is through the playlist option but that just looks mad ugly and I don’t trust it Deezer please sort this out I miss my downloaded music, speaking of which if I go into Deezer without having already connected to the internet or 4G my favourite tracks won’t load and I’m stupid and when I was nine I put all my music onto my favourite tracks and it’s been six years and I might as well keep going. So when I have no internet not only does my favourite tracks playlist not load…but neither does my downloaded music folder (not that I would need it since it would just tell me to shuffle my music (I don’t want to do that)) 

Deezer please sort this out or I am thinking about disowning you as a member of my music family and telling my friends about how bad you are and we all point and laugh “Deezer is stupid” we all chant in unison… If you don’t want that then I recommend you do something about this or I might just join my friends on Spotify and feel out of place…Deezer feels like my second home, However just like my actual home there are a lot of problems 

Why is this app so laggy? Ever since there was this ugly app update that made the logo a purple heart I’ve wanted to rip my own less purple heart out every time I go on the app 

It’s so laggy I genuinely went to get my battery replaced once because I thought it was on me 

Everything is so laggy and takes so long to load It almost feels like bullying, like you’re making fun of me
 “hah, look at her waiting for all her music, she probably listens to horrible music” you all point and laugh at me… Honestly I love this app, that’s why I’ve taken at least 10 minutes of my life to write this, but genuinely sort this out, I did just find out Deezer is a French ran company so maybe that explains it but this app just feels so laggy, I feel like Spotify is smashing my phone all the time to try force me to switch to them every time I go on this app and experience the worst lag of my life But me and Deezer have a blood brothers bond that no one can break, apart from my broken phone after I tap my screen so hard to load a song my screen cracks “no Deezer…” I cry as my phone explodes and the colour it explodes into is the green from the Spotify logo Back to the shuffle thing Who still shuffles these days? I went to my friend to ask her, this is how it went “Do you shuffle?” “Huh?” “On Deezer? Do you shuffle your music?-“ She body slammed me to the floor and called out for everyone to see me “Look! She still uses Deezer in 2024!” I cried No one shuffles anymore, but people do still listen to downloaded music. So why is this gone? I actually feel like a part of me left when I saw the only option was so shuffle, do you know what that does to a person? I would really appreciate it if you could sort this out, whenever I walk past people now they make me do a shuffle and point and laugh at me as I can’t shuffle very well because I’ve only done one dance class in my life and I just wasn’t very good, it’s personal I don’t really want to get into it I’m tired of being called shuffle girl. I’m tired of not seeing my downloaded music, I’m speaking for the masses now as I ride around on my horse and chanting what all Deezer users want “Bring back the downloaded music option folder and make it less laggy and also please make it so I don’t have to already be connected to Wi-Fi to go on my favourite tracks!” I chant as the village cheers me on…I am then stopped by the Spotify guards, I bet they don’t have to deal with this, the evil Spotify thoughts are talking over. I think the only way to get them to go away is to do what I asked in this review, “stop her!” Spotify yells as I use Deezer… The evil Spotify thoughts have now lead me into a deep spiral as I sit in my cell. I don’t know if I mentioned but I got arrested for still using Deezer and have daily tomatoes thrown at me shaped as the Deezer logo so I feel embarrassed and ashamed I can never feel ashamed of my child Deezer As I look out my cell walls and scratch III onto the cell walls I wonder what it’s like to be a Spotify user “Stop” I hear a voice say I turn It’s Beyoncé, my most listened to artist “Beyoncé Giselle Knowles? My most listened to artist with 96 hours? Oh my goodness!” She laughed at me Deezer you made Beyoncé laugh at me What the hell Deezer? “If you used Spotify you would have been able to listen to me more because you wouldn’t have wasted valuable minutes waiting for the app to load” She exploded into the Spotify green and I was left alone in my cell again I’ve fallen into a spiral, all I want is my downloaded music, downloaded music on my non laggy music app I look out my cell window and see a future, not a green Spotify capitalist future, but a beautiful purple one for Deezer, full of baguettes and snails (you’re french run) Deezer I see a beautiful future, but it takes small steps “If only Deezer wasn’t laggy…” I sigh A guard then comes into my cell He talks to me about how if I reset my phone maybe this would sort itself out, but I know my Deezer better than that, I know Deezer isn’t as simple as resetting my phone Deezer You are like my child, and right now you’re going through a weird rebellious emo phase and it’s lead to me being arrested and laughed at by Beyoncé and laughed at by people and having tomatoes thrown at me “Deezer will be fixed!” I yell out to the cell…",1,2025-04-17 01:45:53-07:00

App sometimes freezes when trying to add song to playlist during playback. Playback continues but not clear if and when the app unfreezes, sometimes you have to close it to be able to use it again.

TIDAL,FR,Il y a la musique et il y a l’application,"Bonjour, client de Spotify depuis ses débuts, je suis passé sur TIDAL pour la qualité audio et la connexion DJ. Sur ces points ces impeccables. 
Par contre côté application ce n’est pas le même discours. Et là je suis obligé de dire que l’interface et sa gestion est loin d’être aussi claire et évidente que Spotify qui a sacrément mis l’accent sur la lisibilité de l’interface et l’expérience. 
Ici c’est compliqué de s’y retrouver, sur les morceaux téléchargés aussi. Ça reprend l’esprit mais on en est loin. Quand on passe en mode hors ligne on a plus accès à ses playlist. Donc on dois seulement se contenter de l’accès récapitulatif de « Téléchargement ». Y a vraiment besoin de revoir beaucoup les petits détails, car ils font la différence. Ceci dit j’ai réussi à prendre mes marques et fait avec, mais bon, dans l’espoir d’une amélioration future. 
Le dernier point qui m’a vraiment découragé, il n’y a plus de connexion avec Waze. Et pourtant même dans la voiture j’ai remarqué une sacrée différence de qualité sonore.
Conduire en switchant d’une app à une autre pour changer de titre ce n’est vraiment pas cool ! Surtout que ma nouvelle activité fait que je suis beaucoup sur la route. 
Je n’ai pas trouvé la raison sur le web. Ça serais sympa de communiquer sur de tel changement et d’expliquer pourquoi. 
Merci à l’équipe TIDAL pour votre compréhension. En espérant que tout ceci soit constructif pour une bonne orientation en vue d’une progression dans le niveau et qualité du service au moins égale à celui de la qualité audio investie.",3,2025-04-13 13:23:53-07:00

TIDAL,AU,Love love love! But…,"I cancelled my previous subscription with another platform and decided to try Tidal after great reviews from other music heads. 
I’ve pretty much tried everything, from Spotify, to Apple, to YouTube, and now Tidal. I love Tidal, the quality is as advertised and I found the app easy to navigate. 
My issue is rather small, just small tweaks that I would have loved, I found the music great but the personal experience not so much. I’m a creative person, I want to decorate my app with playlist covers and Tidal doesn’t offer that. On every other platform it is a given because it’s common that people want to get creative with their playlist. This at first didn’t bother me but I soon realised my playlist covers work as a quick guide (I have well over 50 playlist). I’m a true music enjoyer to my core, I like to personalise my experience on any app I listen to music on and unfortunately Tidal doesn’t offer much creativity. I find it to be a bit behind in the user experience compared to its competitors which I don’t understand because for years listeners have voiced their concerns and added what they want to see on the streaming service platform. So although I love Tidal, the small things that add to a users experience did get to me eventually.",4,2025-04-11 10:52:42-07:00

Das andere Problem ist, dass wenn ich Lieder downloade, dass immer ein bis zwei von ihnen hängen bleiben und nicht laden. Ich kann diese Lieder auch nicht mehr wegnehmen und egal was ich mache, sie laden nicht. Das bedeutet wenn ich erneut etwas laden möchte, muss ich nach und nach jedes einzelne Lied abtippen.

SoundCloud,SE,Recent App Update – Poor Playback Experience,"Dear SoundCloud Team,

I’m writing to share my disappointment with the recent update to the SoundCloud app. Since updating, the overall experience has significantly worsened.

One major issue is that songs no longer play properly unless I remain inside the app. This also applies to ads—they won’t play unless I actively keep the app open. This completely breaks the multitasking experience and makes using SoundCloud frustrating, especially when compared to how smooth it was before.

The forced in-app playback feels like a step backwards. I genuinely enjoyed using SoundCloud in the past, but this update has made the platform difficult to enjoy. I hope this is addressed soon, as the current setup is far from user-friendly.

Looking forward to improvements in future updates.",1,2025-04-08 03:53:40-07:00

TIDAL,NL,Good,"Amazing app, some pointers tho. Why Does the app doesnt support 3D touch/ForceTouch? Does not make sense to me. Also, Tidal has the worst search engine ever. It favors popularity over the searchterm which makes lesser known songs harder to find. Other than that, I love it. Why did you change the color of the playing bar to white. It was nice to see in the details which level of audio quality you were listening to. Also the queue management is horrendous. How is it that I play an album and when I want to add another one in the queue, I can only press “play next” which then plays the other album after the first song of the first album. And then when I’ve listened to the both of the albums, they stay exactly like that in the queue even if I start a song from a different source. The artists pages aren’t managed well. Somebody can make a song as “Travis Scott” and it will feature on the real Travis’ page even though he has nothing to do with it",3,2025-04-06 04:51:25-07:00

Se hai un iPhone o altri dispositivi Apple, poi, l’integrazione è perfetta: ti sembra di avere la musica cucita addosso.Adoro le playlist curate da esperti, le radio live come Apple Music 1 e le funzioni come i testi sincronizzati e la modalità Sing. Ma il punto forte per me è la qualità audio: con il Dolby Atmos e il lossless senti davvero la differenza, soprattutto con un buon paio di cuffie.

TIDAL,FR,"Chronophage, travail éditorial indigent.","Bonjour,

En ce qui concerne le mode recherche d’un album ce n’est pas admissible. On compare avec Qobuz : on cherche l’album de Jarrett « At the Deer Head Inn » en tapant le titre exact de l’album : rien du tout, aucun résultat, nada ! Sur Qobuz : même avec le titre partiel, c’est proposé illico !
Même chose avec le violoncelliste Emanuel Fauermann : aucun résultat !
On cherche la bio de Caetano Veloso : nous la trouvons… en portugais ! Indigent.

Au sujet de votre maîtrise technologique, ce n’est guère mieux : votre Tidal Connect est à la ramasse ! À la fin d’une lecture d’un album ou d’une playlist souvent la connexion devient introuvable et le tidal Connect n’est plus proposé. Même chose quand on ajoute des titres à notre playlist on perd la connexion Tidal Connect : il faut tout débrancher, réinitialiser la box et redémarrer le streamer ! Une usine à gaz !

Prenez exemple chez Spotify : oui qualité audio inférieure mais leur spotify connect fonctionne à merveille !

Au prix de votre abonnement, c’est vraiment très très cher payé pour un service aussi minable !

J’ai été très patient. Rien ne change. L’assistance contactée à plusieurs reprises est totalement inefficace !",1,2025-03-23 06:19:54-07:00

1) For the sake of sanity, can we have the ability to sort downloaded music by artist, album, playlist, etc? This is driving me nuts. All other major platforms have this feature.

2) Their music catalogue has inaccurate information and when reported, Tidal is not responding. For example, for artists with the same name, you often see albums attributed to the wrong artist. This ends in your mixes based on your preferences and can be frustrating.

3) Their tvOS app navigation menu is not displaying properly, often being hidden due to improper UI scaling. Also, when a video is playing, you don’t see the artist and song name in the navigation menu. And when you go back to the playlist, it doesn’t highlight the song actually playing.",3,2025-03-20 05:15:19-07:00

TIDAL,NL,Good but could improve,"The sound is great (better than any music app I tried), the look of Tidal is sleek and professional and I love how artists get more money per stream. However, there are three things that need major improvements. English is not my first language for apologies for any grammatical mistakes. 

1. Availability of custom images for playlists and profile picture. This is such a simple update that is not available and widely talked about online and offline. Some people refuse to use Tidal since custom abilities are not available. I would love to see this since the first 4 albums as cover art in a playlist makes it look messy. Second, I had to make a facebook account to change my profile picture, this was truly unnecessary.  

2. It is annoying that if you look up a song with 1 mistake (writing loce instead of love for example) will lose you the ability to search the song. Spotify is way better at this. Also, sometimes I search a song and it does not pop up at all, while knowing it is on Tidal. Then I have to go to the artist and search for the song in their catalog, this is also not optimal. 

3. It is great that there are many official playlists, however pushing user made playlists would be such an improvement. You have the option to make your playlist “public” but no one will be able to see it since it won’t pop up, even if it has many artists you are interested in. I would like to see other actual people with the same interests besides getting a daily mix, it makes it more personal. 

These improvements would make this app 5 stars.",3,2025-03-16 09:13:06-07:00

Deezer,US,"Love the app’s style and platform’s very own style, do wish there were hues of browns, golds, or blu","I use this app. I run on apple’s iOS and OS, recently i tried Apple’s Music, Qobuz, Tidal, Spotify. None of them rivaled to Deezer in terms of music library total focus. I don’t need video, moving álbum pictures, or a news tap. My only complaint to Deezer are two things. 

1. Playlists are limited to 2,000 songs. I f’n absolutely detest that. I love albums but I’m a huge playlists guy for every mood and vibe. But I’d love to be able to merger a few of my personal created playlist to 4,000 songs, better yet, give the customer its own ability to expand them 10k songs if they want to. Please, this is a failure to restrict playlist to 2,000 songs. Nope, it just isn’t right. 

2. I highly considered tidal and qobus do to HI-RES Audio which sounds significantly better, but they lack cross fade and smooth page to page transitions, their platforms are also boring. Not even gonna talk about apply music, or Spotify. I feel them garbage and ADHD styled. lol please work on getting Hifi to HiRes and even Dolby. Everything else you guys are doing is fantastic tho. I have used more than half of my iPhones 1TB memory to access music offline when I’m mature. 

Absolutely love Deezer but have consider leaving for hires only haven’t because other platforms are lacking focus, crossfade, we EQ, and sound check, Deezer offers that. Great job Deezer! Love y’all.",3,2025-03-14 17:01:19-07:00

Sometimes it downloads a Playlist, other times it doesn't, and when you add new songs to it it's a gamble wether or not it will download them for offline use or wether you'll have to delete the downloaded Playlist completely and try again from scratch.

TIDAL,PL,Niewykorzystany potencjał.,"Największy problem to wyszukiwarka – właściwie jej brak. Jeśli chcemy posłuchać muzyki z danego filmu, zapomnijmy o tym. Konkurencja radzi sobie z tym bez problemu, wystarczy wpisać tytuł filmu i mamy cały soundtrack. W Tidalu? Nic z tego.

Kolejna wada to algorytmy rekomendacji. Zamiast proponować nową, dopasowaną muzykę, odświeżają utwory, których słuchaliśmy dawno temu. Lubie poznawać nową muzykę, a tu tragedia. 

Jeśli chodzi o buforowanie muzyki, Tidal wymaga znacznie lepszego połączenia niż konkurencja. Nawet przy niskiej jakości utworów zdarza się, że aplikacja ma problem z płynnym odtwarzaniem.

Jedyny realny plus? Jakość dźwięku. Bez dwóch zdań, jest najlepsza na rynku. Niestety, dla mnie to nie jest kluczowa sprawa, więc zalety nie przeważają nad wadami.

✅ **Why Tidal Wins for me:**  
- **Superior Sound Quality**: Perfectly paired with my AirPods Pro 2 and Sony WH-1000XM4, Tidal’s Hi-Res/Master tracks deliver unmatched clarity.  
- **Audiophile Focus**: Lossless FLAC/MQA files (24-bit/192kHz) outperform Spotify/YouTube Music’s compressed formats.  
- **Exclusive Content**: Master Quality tracks, Dolby Atmos, and artist-centric features add depth to your listening.

3) No sort, search or filter playlists when adding a track
4) No option to either add, move
6) Custom order of tracks exists<3, even though it can be slow for long playlists.
5) No playlist folders or orher means of organizing. I got creative and use a relative numbering system (01-99) (works alphabetically).

TIDAL,DE,"Plus: Der Klang, Minus: Die App","Ich schreibe nie Rezensionen, aber da ich eigentlich das Konzept von Tidal, ein wirklich grandioses Klangerlebnis zu ermöglichen, wunderbar finde, hoffe ich, dass man endlich die Probleme in dieser App in den Griff bekommt. Und ich kann mich wirklich nur anschließen, dass der Sound einfach wunderbar ist. Das war’s dann allerdings schon. Und das reicht auch leider nicht, um all die Probleme, die man mit dieser App hat, auszugleichen.

Abgesehen von Kleinigkeiten wie das fehlerhafte Laden von Inhalten, ein Bug hier und da in der Warteschlange und der schlechten Responsivität des UI, gibt es doch Probleme die für mich inakzeptabel sind und auch der Grund, warum ich für diese App nicht mehr bezahlen möchte.
Zunächst sind da die Fake-Inhalte, die über zu lange Zeiträume in der App verfügbar sind. Das ist an sich schon eine Katastrophe für Künstler. Hinzu kommt, dass Inhalte so unübersichtlich zur Verfügung gestellt werden oder einfach überhaupt nicht in der Suche auftauchen, dass man das Gefühl hat man, arbeite für den Rechercheverbund NDR, WDR und SZ, nur um den bekanntesten Titel eines bestimmten Künstlers zu finde. Mal abgesehen davon, dass viele Künstler mehrere Profile besitzen. Ich will gar nicht wissen, wie dabei die Vergütung für diese Künstler abläuft.
Des Weiteren werden willkürliche Titel (es sind immer dieselben) einfach nicht heruntergeladen und halten die gesamte Warteschlange für Offline-Inhalte auf. 
Und wirklich schade - allerdings zu vertragen - ist für mich, dass man keine lokalen Titel in die Playlists integrieren kann. 

Wofür ich Tidal jedoch ehrlich dankbar bin, ist dass sie mir die Augen geöffnet haben, was ich an Qualität die letzten 15 Jahre verpasst habe.
Deshalb Danke!",2,2025-02-27 06:15:00-07:00

Deezer,US,Do not recommend,"Extremely disappointed, I got Deezer a few weeks ago and ended up getting the one month premium free trial when I discovered the app is basically useless without it. The actual subscription monthly is also $10+ which is typical but kind of inssne. The premium subscription was horrible, it takes so long for the song to skip and if u put a new song on it takes Atleast 5 seconds to start playing. Not only that but when I downloaded my music for when I don’t have wifi it only downloaded like 7 or 8 if my songs out of my 200 song playlist and when I didn’t have WiFi the songs wouldn’t play because it couldn’t connect. Is that not the point of downloading your songs?? I’m supposed to be able to listen without WiFi. It’s also kinda hard to navigate and just overall very slow. Thank you",1,2025-02-26 14:20:55-07:00

Ah oui, et sans oublier la fameuse option pour le DJ que je suis qui permet de jouer tous les titres Tidal sur Djay ou Serato : un vrai confort car ça permet de préparer ses playlists tranquillement et en permanence (dans les transports, en vacances, etc.), puis d’en profiter ensuite instantanément en ouvrant le logiciel de Deejaying. Merciiiii beaucoup",5,2025-02-15 02:22:52-07:00

Apple Music,SE,Music. Pure and Simple.,"An app without an identity crisis. Apple Music puts 100% focus on music. Supporting Dolby Atmos® and Lossless, the audio quality is simply unbeatable.

For those who love to analyze lyrics; its real-time lyrics view and the AI-driven Sing feature which eliminates the vocal track; you can sing along and focus on your own concert. If you prefer the occasional visual immersion; music videos are available and ready to put you closer to the artists vision.

The UI is simple and places focus on albums and your own library. This is in stark difference to the competition, which often pushes playlists, good and bad on you in excess. Of course, if playlists is your way of listening to music; there are there, but they are not the focus.

Q: What about pricing and tiers?
A: There are no ads, and best of all; no complicated pricing tiers. One subscription: 100-million songs.

Q: Is there a “Wrapped” at the end of year?
A: No. There is a “Replay” and it is year-round. Every Monday, your Replay gets updated and every month, you can track your own statistics, share them, and discover more about your musical tastes. At the end of the year; you’ll be given the opportunity to view your year as a whole. Replay is an auto-generated playlist, which you can add to your library.

Q: Can I try it for free?
A: Yes! Apple Music offers a 3-month free trial period. If you are dissatisfied, cancel in-time to avoid any charges at the end of your period.

However, so often when I download songs, despite having good internet connection, it won’t load at all, sometimes work sometimes not… Also it keeps saying that there’s unfinished queue, but that one song is no longer in the playlist, and i can’t remove it from the queue, it just keep flashing there……

Ho tentato di fare una prova, mi si chiedono dati, compreso quelli della carta di credito, che mi paiono più un pegno per la sfiducia e una perdita di stile verso utenti che, per la tipologia di app, generalmente hanno una certa cultura e puntano ad un prodotto di nicchia, spendendo di più. Ma al buio.
Ora visto che la modalità dal tono “aoh caccia li sordi” non mi piace, leggo lo stile poco trasparente di invitare ad una prova gratuita fornendo la carta di credito. Ovviamente le modalità non sono invitanti, anzi penso vi faccia perdere opportunità, ma leggo anche una certa timidezza nel mostrare anche solo un pezzetto di un brano  di ciò che offrite, con orgoglio.  Penso che non sia così oneroso qualche minuto gratuito di musica privo del sapore  della “cambiale” e alimentato dall’ansia di chi si è ritrovato nei bug di impossibilità di disdetta a prezzi maggiorati. Se credete nel prodotto perché metterlo così nascosto. Perché non promuoverlo? Sarà pure una questione di non credere forse in ciò che si vende, o una strana legge del marketing.

I really enjoy listening to the songs you guys bring, 
But recently… there’s been a small problem that’s been bugging me a lot.
It’s just that whenever I put a song on my favorites list, it’s get put on there twice. 
Eg.
After that song finishes it plays again only I didn’t put it on replay, it replays because it’s been put there twice. And yes I’ve tried unfavoriting one of the 2 but then it just removes both of them in the end.

You feel me? It’s happened in the past but it would normally go away when I unfavorite one of the songs. Then there would just be one, and it wouldn’t delete both of them entirely. Just one, this is new tho. So I would really appreciate it if you fixed it!

The main thing that really bothers me is the “shuffle”/“random” mode. It is always the same queue when you apply this to a song. No matter what day, time, how you found the song or whatever. This also seems to apply to starting a “song mix”. I’d hope it would mix differently every time, but it doesn’t.

I’m currently using the free trial and I planned to just hop from service to service. But now that I’ve tried this Deezer, it’s been the best music listening experience I’ve ever had, even better than I’ve had with Spotify or Apple Music. If y’all are in these reviews looking for a reason to download it, just test out the free trial and trust me, you’ll never want to let it go. The music quality is top tier, you can transfer playlists from other services, and it’s not like other apps that have a mostly user-submitted song-base. 10/10 would highly recommend.",5,2025-01-20 19:53:24-07:00

I have a reference atmos cinema, where 0dB (my volume limit) is at cinema reference which this cinema is calibrated to. Stereo music at -10dB is loud (0dB is heading towards concert level). Movies are typically played at -10 to -5dB. 

Now Tidal atmos music at 0dB (max volume) is quiet so very little bass, and obviously crushed dynamic range. 

I’ve since found this is a well documented problem with Tidal not just on Apple TV but other hardware platforms. 

Not such problem with the native music service.

In term of bugs, the most annoying one is that I have to occasionally uninstall and reinstall the app to purge the excess of space my downloads take on my phone (even though I have carefully selected the low downloads option to listen to my music offline).

Second bugs; since at least a year or two, I no longer can add favourites to the songs I like. It’s like I reached too many likes. I am not sure why it does that.

TIDAL,FR,Mauvaise expérience,"Les + :
- le hi-fi

Les - :
- des bugs à répétition en l’espace de 3 mois d’utilisation.
- le téléchargement des musiques qui se bloque et oblige à supprimer du téléchargement et remettre.
- des lenteurs abusés (par exemple juste pour affiché une playlist d’environ 1000 morceaux, on a un temps d’attente. Pareil pour lancer l’aléatoire) le chargement différé vous connaissez ?
- si j’ai pas de connexion et que je lance l’application je suis déconnecté donc je ne peux pas écouter la musique hors connexion
- pour supprimer une musique d’une playlist c’est un enfer. Pas le choix de scroller jusqu’au titre à supprimer dans la playlist. Bon courage si vous avez une grosse playlist.

TIDAL,AU,I tried really hard to like this,"The music quality is great, and this is almost a good app. The bugs let it down. The Apple CarPlay app is useless and has to be controlled from the phone or it simply can’t see your music - the top 50 tracks in a playlist is all that’s ever usable from the car. I was working with that… but I went to all the trouble of downloading my songs, which bugged out and broke a few times, then got on a plane. The first flight I had music… the second it decided I’d logged out and therefore had nothing downloaded. I had no music the whole flight. The app I was using before has never logged me out unexpectedly and I’ve had music on many flights without issue.

My Chord Mojo and my Dragonfly Cobalt headphone DAC/amps have a colour indicator that identifies what the bitrate and sampling frequency is, so Tidal can’t fool me.  Something must have happened in the last update?  My Apple Lossless platform works fine as it streams many of the same albums in hi-rez.

More options on what types of music we can search up as you can. And make all music transferable so nothing is missing. And turn the videos that aren’t music into audio so we can still use them. Make music videos available, please? And I want suggest one last thing get the word out about this amazing app through social media platforms. That’s where people will see your app and use it, because right now not too many know about this app so with that I wish you guys the best of luck! And one last thing I forgot to mention, make it possible to put music on multiple playlists at a time and let multiple devices use the same account at the same time and hey there’s a genre of music you forgot: LGBT everything is perfect now except for one last thing I can’t get my Christmas flow on my tv and I bet if you keep improving and spreading the word about your app that you could even replace Spotify as the number one music app, you up to the challenge? And what by all holidays, is make music available for for all holidays because there’s more than just Christmas that people celebrate right, and also to make a flow playlist for each and every holiday in the world to appeal to a wider audience and multiple devices.And also you also ruined your app by asking about cookies, good apps don’t have that and I would greatly appreciate it if you could put the Christmas flow on my tv and possibly make it possible for more than one device can play on someone’s account please it would really improve the quality of the app if you guys really only want one device at a time on an account why not create a button to turn on and off all the devices attached to the app, please? Now my deezer isn’t even playing there’s no sound no music is playing on my tv or my phone the only way to fix deezer when it stops is to turn off the tv and to kill the app then turn them back on and me make one thing clear I’m pointing out all the things that’s wrong with the app so you can fix them! If you fixed them it would improve your app drastically and not all the flow playlists that are on the phone are on the tv and I just thought of something what if you guys made it possible to continue the playlist from another device? If they’re trying to listen to the same playlist? Now my music isn’t playing at all on my tv and they only listen if you give them a good review and even when you try to suggest something to make the app better they go and mess it up in a few hours to a day. And my music isn’t working at all now on my tv and what I meant by advertise is advertising your own app and doesn’t work like a charm and you have to pay to have any of your own music and it’s like their punishing me for trying to help now. And the app on my tv doesn’t work at all now this is the worse Christmas present I could ever have gotten myself. I’m going back to my quality apps",1,2024-12-21 10:56:43-07:00
TIDAL,PL,Prawie prawie,"Jakościowo naprawdę słychać różnicę, głównie dlatego przesiadłem się od konkurencji 😁 Zdecydowanie pochwała! Aplikacja już nie przestaje ""tak o"" odtwarzać. Ale są zastrzeżenia - np jak odtwarzam dłuższą playlistę to otwarcie widoku listy nie nadąża za obecnie odtwarzaną ścieżką, trzeba szukać. Pierdółka, ale dla mnie odczuwalna, jak odtwarzam 2,5k polubionych utworów na losowym 😉 Przy CarPlay dużym problemem jest dla mnie to, że wczytuje się tylko kilkanaście pierwszych utworów z polubionych lub kilka pierwszych albumów z zapisanych. Przez to ""losowe"" jest odtwarzanie w kółko tego samego bo aplikacja nie wczytuje dalszych utworów. Wisienką byłaby możliwość sterowania innym urządzeniem np. przełączanie utworów w aplikacji komputera w aplikacji na telefonie 😁",4,2024-12-21 10:55:18-07:00

I literally wait for about 20-25 seconds every time I launch it on my iPhone 13, which has a fast processor. It’s only about 2 years old and runs everything else fast including Spotify, so I’m sure it’s a performance issue in Deezer. BTW, I have downloaded about 1000 tracks and have about 50 playlists, so I don’t know if the issue has to do with that, but I’m mentioning those details to Deezer in case they help them fix it.

But there is an issue. There are some albums where songs should play one after another without pauses, like it’s the one song. But in Tidal there are pauses between tracks and it kills all the experience, especially with live albums. Apple Music doesn’t have this problem. Please fix it as soon as possible, maybe add prebuffpering of the next song while 10 last seconds of previous song is playing. 
And one more small thing. The audio format details are not shown in Google TV app (bit depth and sample rate), it says only HIGH or MAX. I would like to be able to see this information just like on my iOS devices. Thank you!",4,2024-12-15 12:33:29-07:00

TIDAL,NL,Gapless,"Hallo, ik heb sinds een week of 2 problemen met het afspelen van Tidal op mijn iPhone en iPad. Dit gaat niet meer gapless, wat dus vooral bij live-albums goed merkbaar is door de knip tussen de tracks.

Het afspelen via Tidal Connect naar Sonos gaat wel goed, afspelen via Apple TV en Windows laptop gaat ook goed.

Afspelen via Airplay naar Sonos geeft hetzelfde probleem, dus alles wat via iPhone of iPad gaat is niet meer gapless.

Afspelen via Apple Music gaat ook zonder problemen, maar ik geef toch de voorkeur aan Tidal (tenminste als dit probleem opgelost kan worden).

Ik heb hierover al contact gehad met support van Tidal en Apple en van alles geprobeerd, maar zonder resultaat. Apple adviseerde mij om contact op te nemen met de ontwikkelaar van de app. 

Hebben jullie enig idee wat de oorzaak/oplossing kan zijn?

Mvg,

Deezer,US,One of the best apps,"I just got this app, first impressions, it looks like every other music app; SoundCloud, Spotify, and pandora. Apples music looks different but they both have nearly the same sound quality. The better surround/spatial sound goes to Deezer, the better Sound/voice quality goes to Apple Music. It’s a small difference but the vocals sound louder than Apple Music. Also yes, Deezer and Apple Music are better than Spotify. Deezer has easier to follow menus when clicking on artists and main menu. I have all of the best quality subscriptions on SoundCloud, Apple Music, Spotify, and Deezer. So I know what I’m talking about. You should go with Deezer if you love hearing those individual background noises and Apple Music if you want more clear vocals.
 
If I could, I would give this app a 4.5/5 stars but a 5/5 for the round up. Highly recommend!!",5,2024-12-13 14:16:39-07:00

In response to the developer reply I find it completely unacceptable that such a fundamental change has not been communicated to subscribers and that as a paying customer for many years I am now expected to pay the same amount for much less of an offering than I had before. I am able to download podcasts with other apps so this is what I will now do. Deezer has lost me as a customer and just doesn’t seem to care.",1,2024-11-26 14:28:33-07:00

Deezer is incredibly painful to navigate and is lacking basic user friendly processes such as deleting multiple songs from a playlist whilst on mobile. The app also constantly refreshes whenever it’s not being used so pausing songs often leads to the song restarting and the app has a small load up time so there are constant breaks in music. 5 star rating to hopefully get more attention and save u making the mistake i made.

Deezer,GB,I have had deezer before.,"As the title says, I’ve had deezer before. It was fun until it was playing songs NOT on the album ?? Coming to present, it still happens! You can’t listen to an album. It has to be similar songs like the album, or the song. You can’t play it on command and I really done like that as I don’t recognise any of these songs that come on. I can’t use Apple Music nor YouTube Music because Apple Music isn’t free, and YouTube Music won’t let me log in. Yet it’s free, it’s still buggy. Can you please let us play the playlist and not have to listen to the full track for a ridiculous price? It’s just a waste, if you let us in for free then let us play music for free. Instead there should be perks for paying, including spontaneously switching to lyrics or the track. Instead you have to pay to see the lyrics unlike YouTube Music. Please read this. You will improve so much..

TIDAL,NO,"Veldig bra musikkapp, men trenger forbedringer","Er veldig fan av Tidal og har brukt appen fra de ble kalt WiMP. Digger layotet til appen og lyden og kvalitetene på sangene er veldig bra. Det som må forbedres er en enklere måte å få sanger i køen fra du søker på den. Man burde kunne «swipe» for å legge den i køen. Jeg vet det går ann noen plasser, men de bør endre det slik at den sangen du «swipet» sist, spilles sist

Ønsker også at de sangene man selv har lagt til i køen etter køen fra en spilleliste, sang eller album også vises etter at den er spilt slik at man kan gå tilbake til samme sang uten å måtte legge den til igjen. Dette gikk ann før.

Lyden er også merkbar bedre, mer fylde og detaljer i musikken 😍 Låtene Tidal gjetter at jeg vil like treffer også mye bedre enn Spotify sine gjetninger.

Deezer,GB,Avoid! ROB you of YOUR hard earned MONEY and DON’T CARE,"Actually really liked this app during a free trial, so when my Apple Music sub ran out I decided to move and pay for Premium. Big mistake. They took £14.99 from my account, and my account never went Premium. After contacting support on multiple occasions, after getting through to a real human, they were nothing short of useless and the total opposite of empathetic. They have basically robbed me of £14.99 and have no interest in delivering any service. I have now given up with this amateur company. I wondered why I’d never heard of them before until one day I searched the App Store for something, this must be why. Thieves. Rancid company, avoid like the plague.",1,2024-08-22 13:24:36-07:00

Love the lossless tracks on my system.

Great price structure and the pay the artist’s well compared to other services.

Unfortunately it doesn’t have as extensive library of extreme and obscure metal compared to Spotify.

TIDAL,NL,Overall review,"I’ve been using Tidal more than a year by now and I have to say that I’m pleased with the sound quality as it is it’s core point but there are still some simple short comings. My most listened list is a good example for this matter, tracks being repeated constantly. You can see the same tracks popping up literally 3-4 times in the list. That is pretty annoying when you want to download what you listen most (for a flight or etc). Me being mostly an album listener I notice also the tracks that I mostly skip in the album showing up also in the “Most listened tracks” list which is ironically funny. Except that it just delivers what is promised, flac quality audio on tracks that is available. The albums that were also uploaded as low quality in past is also getting upgraded with “High” resolution, which is also something that I can appreciate.",3,2024-08-16 10:05:50-07:00

SoundCloud,NO,SoundCloud is (not) a joke. I received amazing support!,"I’ve been using SoundCloud for a while to share my music with friends, family, and for my own enjoyment. Recently, I signed up for the Next Pro free trial to explore more features. However, I was suddenly logged out of my account, and when I tried to log back in, I discovered that my account had been completely deleted without any warning or explanation. Then I got an email that my Next Pro was canceled with a link to a survey asking me why I canceled my subscription. What’s most frustrating is that I had two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, and I always adhered to SoundCloud’s terms of service. All my AI-created content was clearly labeled as AI, AI Covers had “AI Covers” in the titles, and my music is deeply personal, addressing my experiences with mental health and addiction. Losing access to this content was both distressing and confusing, especially since my regular SoundCloud subscription through Apple was still active.

I reached out to SoundCloud support and initially did not receive a satisfactory explanation. I was deeply disappointed and frustrated by this experience. SoundCloud informed me that they had suspended my account because they detected automation, which I did not engage in. However, they have now reactivated my account, and I am incredibly grateful for the resolution. The support representative who handled my case was very empathetic and understanding, and they sincerely apologized for the inconvenience caused. They assured me that my account is secure and that this issue won’t happen again. Because of this positive experience and their prompt response to fix the issue, I’m happy to update my review from 1/5 to 5/5.",5,2024-08-14 06:30:44-07:00

Deezer,ES,Decepcionante experiencia con Deezer,"Actualizo la app después de la respuesta del desarrollador diciendo que la culpa es de la caché y que la app funciona de maravilla.Sigue pasando el mismo problema: cuando vas a reproducir una canción, se pausa a los 3 segundos automáticamente haciendo una experiencia nefasta , aveces incluso cuando vas a reproducir canciones descargadas tarda 2 segundos cosa que no tiene sentido ya que están descargadas . En cuanto pueda, me doy de baja. Es una pena porque me parecía algo más original que las otras plataformas de música.

-------------------

Estoy profundamente decepcionado con el rendimiento de Deezer en iOS 17. Tengo Deezer Premium y, a menudo, la aplicación se pausa sola mientras escucho música, lo cual es extremadamente frustrante. No estoy seguro de si el problema está relacionado con el hecho de que también tengo la app instalada en el Apple Watch Ultra, pero la experiencia en general es inaceptable. Además, la app se congela con demasiada frecuencia, obligándome a cerrarla y volver a abrirla constantemente. Esto ocurre en un iPhone 15 Pro Max con mucha memoria libre, así que claramente no es un problema de mi dispositivo. Aunque me gusta la app, estos problemas me están haciendo reconsiderar mi suscripción. Estoy considerando volver a Spotify o YouTube Music, donde nunca he tenido estos inconvenientes. Quiero resaltar que no es un problema de conexión a internet, ya que las canciones están descargadas en mi teléfono. La app está actualizada a la última versión de software y estoy usando la última versión de iOS disponible, así que no entiendo por qué estos problemas persisten. Por favor, solucionen estos problemas pronto; de lo contrario, perderán un cliente.",2,2024-08-12 03:51:16-07:00

TIDAL,NZ,A barely functional app that endlessly breaks,"Tidal is a lovely idea in theory but a piece of junk in reality. It’s not so much production software as someone’s first year coding project brought to life. 

While the basics are fine, the implementation of subscriptions is dire - and this is from someone who’s been a subscriber since the app was launched. Really, it’s inept. 

I’m continually being sent around and around in circles trying to login - and it doesn’t matter if you use an email login or an Apple ID. Tidal will routinely forget your login, demand a new subscription, and lose all your tracks and playlists. Get used to being charged multiple times for the same subscription, and always being at risk of losing every single item you’ve ever saved. 

The big attraction of Tidal has always been the hifi codecs including MQA. But with other apps moving to these, the case for Tidal gets worse every day. Had they put more effort into getting the basic subscription functionality right, I’d happily stay … but let’s face it, no-one wants to be continually forced to recreate their account over and over again. So that’s a fail on the first year coding project, and a one-star review.",1,2024-06-27 22:33:57-07:00

TIDAL,NZ,Doesn’t maintain a connection,"Tidal is a great service with amazing sound quality but the Connect app is a disappointment. I’m using it on an iPad Air that isn’t used for any other purpose except connecting to a Bluesound Node and the app will randomly lose its connection to the Node and revert to playing through the iPad speakers. It also loses the connection whenever the iPad goes to sleep, which makes it hard to play a playlist or album. Using the BluOS app with Tidal as a source works flawlessly, so it’s the Tidal app which is the problem. Unfortunately with BluOS’s UI/UX limitations this is a frustrating problem.",2,2024-06-23 00:01:10-07:00

There are a few things that I find frustrating — such as not being able to sort downloaded albums. I think the default is by download date 🤯.

Deezer,PL,Deezer is confused on CarPlay,"I’ve been a Deezer user for 7 years now. I’ve enjoyed the Hi-Fi experience ever since but there’s just one thing that has been irritating me more and more every month for good 3 years now. Deezer won’t always proceed playing music on CarPlay. Sometimes it requires me to start playing two different songs, sometimes it does not work and I have to manually play a song using the mobile app. Sometimes it loads the song, it looks like it’s ready to play but nothing happens. Can’t skip to another song, can’t do anything. Once it’s rolling, it’s rolling. But sometimes it’s just impossible to get it to work and I give up after 15 minutes because I need to focus on the road, not on a phone/multimedia display. If this is related to poor signal anyhow, then putting such info on the display would drastically improve the UX. Please do something about it.",4,2024-05-24 14:39:24-07:00

With a great hi fi system I can actually hear the great quality of sound offered by Deezer, true, some older songs aren’t the best quality by their nature , I’m talking early 70’s or there about. The new stuff is magic. You just need to pay for the great feature set and great sound quality. Please don’t expect premium features for a fee of $$$ZERO , it just doesn’t work like that. You can always subscribe and cancel if you don’t like it. There are times when I travel overseas snd I freeze my payments till I get home.

Deezer,CA,Redisign,"My opinions on the redisign:
App logo: i prefer this one, but i preferred the multicolour of the last one, maybe making the heart multiple colours to? Also, the middle oval seems too low.
Ui and placement of stuff: i was very used to the old placements and would just click on them without thinking, the new one is more intuitive (and better looking) but it takes some getting used too.
Font: i dont like it. It literally looks like fortnite’s font
These things: the blind test and podcast rectangular icon thingies are so god-awfully ugly, I genuinely despise it
Top genres: in the home, there is your top favourite genres, they are words in rectangular boxes, i dont like em

Not about the redisign: 
Id love a list of ALL the genres you can choose from in your flow.
Also, the explore tab is mid, make it better. the suggestions in the explore tab should be divided in:
1. Things similar to what you like
2. Things that have a similar vibe than what you like but different genre
3. Things completely out of your comfort zone
These three things i think should be in different sections of the explore tab",3,2023-11-08 15:56:48-07:00

TIDAL,NZ,Maybe some of the worst optimisation issues I’ve experienced,"I recently swapped to tidal from Spotify because of recent subscription prices changing, tidal supporting artists better and features that annoyed me so much from Spotify but only after a few days can I say this was by far the worse decision I’ve made. 

Sure the better audio quality is good but is it really worth it? Listening on multiple different audio devices. I can barely tell the difference, which considering this costs more then Spotify and is one of it’s main selling point is quite disappointing.

The app performance is actually abysmal. The app doesn’t often register when I try to play a song, won’t turn shuffle on after tapping it maybe 5 times; would lag when I tried to swap playlists that I was listening to, would quite often not add a song to a playlist and then I’m left confused on where the song is and many more optimisation issues. For a music streaming app this piss poor optimisation when it comes to doing the thing it’s made for, listening to music, is genuinely astonishing.

I will be returning to Spotify, which saddens me, because I did want to support artists better but I feel like I’m being absolutely ripped off here. I don’t get all the praise this app gets when it works like absolute trash.",2,2023-07-30 12:18:11-07:00

It would be nice if there was an adaptive option for sound quality, rather than having to change it down when service is bad and then turn it back up when service is good. It’s frustrating when I think I have good service so I set the quality high, I hop on my bike and put my phone away.

Deezer,FI,I wanted to like it,"Got free trial after purchasing Sony earbuds. I’ve been using YouTube Music for few years and really like it but decided to give Deezer a try. Also tried Tidal, Spotify and Apple Music. 

App seems more feature-rich than YTM and more usable than Apple Music. Reminds me of Spotify in that there’s loads of playlists to choose from. Love the hifi sound quality and that it pays artists more than some other streaming services. Also European tech companies ftw. 

So what’s wrong? The app is slow. Like really slow. Starting a song takes several seconds and often results into warning message of long loading times. It also doesn’t seem to learn my taste despite using it pretty much every day for some time. I often have to skip some random annoying pop song Deezer seems to love. 

YTM knew me basically from day one and I’ve gotten used to not needing to babysit my music app. Also I listen to a lot of electronic music and hip hop and love, love, love the idea that my music service has all those remixes, live sets etc. I might want even if there aren’t any “official” albums. 

It’s not that Deezer is bad. Might choose it over Spotify, Apple Music etc. for the app features and artist payouts alone. But for me YTM just gets out of the way and does what I want without me needing to think about it.",3,2022-04-28 11:47:34-07:00
Deezer,SE,"It’s music, not politics","I’ve been using Deezer since 2018 enjoying it, collecting music, and creating playlists. Flow was nice, functionally too. But then they simply disconnected my account from premium within 1 day, since it was identified as Russian. Just saying: Deezer is no longer available in your country. Even though for several last years I’ve been living in Sweden, it’s not the point I’d like to emphasize. They did it in relation to the war in Ukraine, but how are simple civilian people, enjoying music, related to this?! The music and art in general are those things that vise versa help people to push away the aggression from their minds, to find peace and refuse the war. Moreover, it’s very nationalistic — disconnecting people simply because they belong to some nation.

Deezer,JP,普通,"レビューを見て半信半疑で入れましたが普通にいいと思います。
解約方法がわかりづらいという意見がちらほらありましたが、今やネット上のあちこちに方法は載っていますのですぐにできました。
今日SONYのコードで無料登録し、約1時間後に解約しましたが３ヶ月分は一応無料みたいですね。
新規レビューに解約したのに次の月の分払われていた。もったいない。とありましたが、次の月の分は使えますよ。まずサイトに期限日の二日前までに解約しないといけないとかいてありました。ちゃんと読んでないみたいですね。
内容について、普段Spotifyなどを使っていれば不満点も出るかもしれませんが、私はそんなにマイナーな曲は聴かないので私みたいな人にはあってるかも。
最近、上白石萌音さんにハマってるのですが彼女の曲も色々揃ってました。BTS、Queenはもちろん、オペラなどクラシックもかなり揃ってたと思います。ただ、海外の曲は英語検索しないといけないものとそうでないもの…色々ありました。リストのカンパネラはイタリア語？でないと出ませんでしたねー。辻井さんのは少なかったです。
他には…エンヤもありました！
結構ありますね^o^
コナンの主題歌はあまり揃ってませんでした。なんといってもガネクロがない。B'z、倉木麻衣などがない。コナクラにはちと不便かも。テーマ曲はありました！
私の好みだけで見ると、コナン以外はみんな揃ってますよ！笑

日本のポッドキャストはあまりないが、「英語の勉強するには最適」なものが数多くありました。

検索に不便な点、体験版？のやり方がわからない・使えない、初心者への配慮が少ない点がマイナス評価の原因です。他の人も言ってますが「とりあえず金くれ感」があるな…",3,2021-07-08 08:10:59-07:00

One thing that could be fixed is that there can be more than one person listening.......I’m not sure if it’s already gotten fixed but........the app is seriously the BEST!

Deezer,JP,AppleTV Appの提供を切望します😊,"昔のDeezer Japanさんのサービスは余り誉められたものでは無いと感じていましたが、会社の理念の象徴とも言えるアプリデザインから、志のある会社である事は伺えていました。

アップデートもメジャーアップデートの連続とも言える、非常に労力のかかる仕事をたゆまなく、かつ頻繁に繰り返されている点にも、とても好感を覚えていました。

もはや、今のDeezer Japanさんのサービスは非常に洗練されたものにあり、とても私は感激しています。
Apple Watch アプリで、あれほどお気に入りの登録がしやすいUIは中々見られるものではありません。知る限りではAppleさんと、僕の大嫌いなSpotifyくらいだったように思います。

それ故に、職人さんの集団とも取れる、貴社を深く尊敬しています。

その上でお願いがあります。
AppleTVはまだまだ発展途上のデバイスではありますが、Apple Arcadeの登場と、最新tvosにおいて、ゲーム専用機のコントローラーが対応した以上、これまでろくに遊べるゲームアプリが存在しないが故に全く広く普及しなかったこのデバイスも、いずれは広く普及していくでしょう。
普及さえしてしまえば多くのデベロッパーさん達がこのデバイスのアプリ開発に注力し始め、ゲーム以外のアプリも洗練されたものへと変わっていくと思います。

私自身としては、そのような形で自己考察しているのでApple TV 4Kを購入し、今はApple TV+を1年間無料で楽しんでいます。それにHDモデルは搭載しているCPUが脆弱すぎるのでHDモニタで使うにしても価格差を考えると明らかに4Kモデルのお得ですね。

おっと、少し話が逸れてしまいましたね。

CHROME CASTやAMAZON ECHOの音質では音響マニアの私では聴くに耐えません。
その点AppleTVは24bit/48kHzが音質の限界のようですが、チューニングが洗練されているのか充分に音楽を楽しめます。

まだ時期としては早計であり、個人的なわがまに過ぎないですが、AppleTVアプリを提供しては頂けないでしょうか？切に願います。

余談ですが、私はDeezer Japanでプレイリストを作っておられるNamiさんの大ファンです!!

彼女の作るプレイリストには妥協がなく、流行の音楽にも温かな音楽を散りばめ、時代性にとらわれず、万人の心が豊かになる事を意識して作ってるようにさえ思えます。

実はAmazonMusic HDにもしばらく浮気したのですが、ただ音がいいだけでUIは使いづらいし、いい音楽との出会いもなく、私にとっては非常につまらないサービスでした。
ですが、私は音響マニアで高音質な音楽を聴くことに異常なまでの執着があるので、AmazonさんとDeezer Japanさんの2択を迫られた時、非常に悩みました。

私がDeezer Japanさんを選択した最後のひと押しは、Naomiさんの卓越したプレイリストの感性でした。心から尊敬しております。
ちなみに特にお気に入りのプレイリストは、
「カラオケで歌おう」です 笑

Deezer Japnの皆さん、Namiさん、これからもお仕事頑張ってください🤗
陰ながら応援させて頂きますね❗️👍",5,2019-12-29 10:29:05-07:00

Deezer,JP,高音質,確かに謳い文句通り、高音質。他のストリーミングサービスに比べると一皮剥けた感じ。ただし、収録されている音源の数は圧倒的に少ない。クラシックでは、聴きたい曲が無い、と言うことは無いが、好きなアーティストがあるとは限らない、と言うか無い方が多い。そのあたりとコストの見合いかと。,4,2019-04-13 06:09:15-07:00

Deezer,FI,Avutonta sähellystä,"Mulla oli pari vuotta sitten Deezer käytössä. Flow toimi uskomattomalla tavalla. Se ehdotti oikeasti uusia biisejä ja artisteja mistä tykkäät hyvin todennäköisesti eikä ehdotukset heitelleet näin rajusti kuin nykyisin. 300 tykätyllä biisillä ehdotukset heitteli Jari Sillanpäästä tukka/spandeksiheviin, vaikka omat lempibiisit järjestään industriaalimetallia ja metallia. No yksi ilta merkkasin turhautuneena 1000kpl lempibiisiä lisää (99% metallia) josko flow toimisi sitten paremmin. Ei. Samat sillanpäättähkätkaijakoot tulee vieläkin vaikka oon niitä flowssa estänyt kaikkia. Ei tässä deezerissä ole enää mitään järkeä, jopa spotifyn suositukset toimii paremmin.
